# Targeted Pressure Executor (TPE)

This tool executes targeted pressure test plans generated by `generate_pressure_plan.py`.

## Overview

`TPE` (Targeted Pressure Executor) is a standalone command-line tool designed to execute pre-defined, targeted pressure test plans against LLMs. It focuses on precision and reliability in executing tests, leaving the analysis and plan generation to other specialized tools in the pipeline.

## Key Features

*   **Plan-Driven Execution**: Executes tests based on a Markdown plan file.
*   **Role Support**: Can apply a specific role prompt to the model before testing.
*   **Robustness**: Includes basic retry logic for API calls.
*   **Structured Output**: Logs results in a structured JSON format.

## Usage

For detailed usage instructions, including how to integrate TPE into a full testing workflow for both baseline model personalities and specific role扮演, please see the [Usage Guide](USAGE.md).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Example for testing a model's baseline personality
python run_tpe.py --model_name "ollama/gemma3:latest" --role_name "default" --plan_file "path/to/baseline_pressure_plan.md"

# Example for testing a model's performance in a specific role
python run_tpe.py --model_name "ollama/gemma3:latest" --role_name "a1" --plan_file "path/to/role_a1_pressure_plan.md"
```
